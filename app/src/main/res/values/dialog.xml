            You arrive at the east of the forest, where a curse lays. As you enter you are met with a vast plain of flowers. Though the sight is beautiful, you know that the pale white color of the petals is a sign that the flower has been removed of its life force<br>
            <br>
            In the distance, you see a figure huddled underneath a tree in the middle of the area.<br>
            It seems to be…laughing?

            You hear a booming roar, and in the distance, a colossal figure rises from the horizon. Its head then moves towards your direction, and it begins to fly.
